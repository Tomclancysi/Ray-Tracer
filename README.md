# Ray-Tracer

An offline renderer : path tracer. Just a personal toy for learning and playing.



## Features

- BVH tree for fast intersection detection;
- Octree for triangle mesh to accelerate intersection detection;
- Intel TBB multi-threading for rendering acceleration; 
- Monte Carlo method for important sampling; 
- Lambertian, dielectric and metal material.  



## Update log

- 2020.1.8: Add octree data structure for triangle mesh to accelerate intersection detection.
